<--------      React Carousel     --------->
1. I built this react carousel with the help of React hooks:- useEffect and useState.

2. This can take input as a Image and Text from the user.

3. I write the function logic with the help of useState:- First set the initial state = 0; then using useEffect inside it setInterval to set the   timing of an auto-sliding effect of the carousel.
----> user can set the auto-sliding effect timing by changing the interval provided.
